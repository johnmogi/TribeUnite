I'm excited to help you develop your game! Let me check the project structure to understand what we're working with.


Let me check the existing game-related files to better understand the current setup.


Let's create a solid plan for developing your web-based collectible card roguelike game with a tarot theme. Here's a well-structured approach:

### Game Concept
1. **Core Gameplay**: A roguelike deckbuilder where players collect and combine tarot cards, each with unique abilities and synergies.
2. **Progression System**: Players navigate through a maze, battling enemies, and unlocking new tarot cards.
3. **Narrative Elements**: The game serves as a tool for self-discovery, with the maze representing the subconscious mind.

### Technical Stack
1. **Frontend**: 
   - **Framework**: Next.js (already in use)
   - **Rendering**: Canvas for smooth animations
   - **State Management**: Zustand or Jotai for game state
   - **Animation**: Framer Motion or GSAP for smooth transitions

2. **Backend**:
   - **API**: Next.js API routes
   - **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma (already set up)
   - **Authentication**: NextAuth.js

3. **Game Loop**:
   - **Turn-based Combat**: Players and enemies take turns playing cards.
   - **Deck Management**: Players can add, remove, and upgrade cards.
   - **Procedural Generation**: Generate mazes and encounters dynamically.

### Development Phases
1. **Phase 1: Core Mechanics**
   - Set up the game loop and basic card system.
   - Implement the battle system.
   - Create a simple maze navigation system.

2. **Phase 2: Content & Progression**
   - Design and implement tarot cards with unique abilities.
   - Add enemies and bosses.
   - Implement the progression system.

3. **Phase 3: Polish & Polish**
   - Add animations and visual effects.
   - Balance the game.
   - Implement sound design.

### Next Steps
1. **Set Up the Game Directory**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p src/app/game/{components,lib,hooks,assets}
   ```

2. **Create Basic Game Components**:
   - `GameBoard.tsx`: Main game container.
   - `PlayerDeck.tsx`: Player's deck of cards.
   - `EnemyDeck.tsx`: Enemy's deck of cards.
   - `Battlefield.tsx`: Area where cards are played.
   - `Maze.tsx`: Maze navigation interface.

3. **Define Game State**:
   - Player stats (health, energy, etc.).
   - Deck and hand management.
   - Enemy AI and behavior.

4. **Implement the Game Loop**:
   - Player turn: Play cards, use abilities.
   - Enemy turn: AI makes decisions.
   - Resolve effects and update game state.
